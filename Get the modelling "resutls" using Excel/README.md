## *How to use it*

Simply download the file, and allows the macro excution then :
  - open the file
  - navigate to the "QTQt" ribbon
  - click on "Import Summary.txt"
  - select the main file generated by QTQt (call "QTQt.txt" or the name you gave to the run ".txt").
  - clik on wanted extraction button when your are on a sheet with an imported "Summary.txt" 

note : if the imported file is big, the importation could take time (1-2min)

note 2 : it gonna work for both forward and inverted model

## *What you can do*

You can use this file to retrieve different "basic" results :
  - helium : Rs, Pred. Ages, Obs. Ages, Error (Obs. Ages), Tc cross, Cristal type, eU, Pred. Ages (Corr)
  - fission tracks : red. Ages, Obs. Ages and associat errors
  - fission tracks length : nothing by now, but i know how to do it if you want...

Or "more specif" modelling information :
  - time step
  - temperature step
  - damaging
  - ...

## Future

Basically the file is able to retrieve any information included in the "Summary.txt" but I only develop the part for helium and fission tracks. So, if you are interested to get more information from it, don't hesitate to look in the code or ask me.
