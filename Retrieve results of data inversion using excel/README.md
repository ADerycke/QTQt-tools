## *How to use it*

Simply download the file, and allows the macro excution then :
  - open the file
  - navigate to the "QTQt" ribbon
  - click on "Import Summary.txt"
  - select the main file generated by QTQt (call "QTQt.txt" or the name you gave to the run ".txt").

note : if the imported file is big, the importation could take time (1-2min)
note 2 : it gonna work for both forward and inverted model

## Future

Basically the is able to retrieve any information included in the "Summary.txt" but I only develop the part for helium and fission tracks. So, if you are interested to get more information from, don't hesitate to look in the code or ask me.
