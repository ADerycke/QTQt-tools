*how it work ?*

  - what is a code ??? : i can provide an .exe file that you can use just by cliking on it (windows user only by now)
  - intermediate code user : use the code named "PyQt", is based on a graphical interface (Qt) so you don't need any specific knowledge to run it, except installing the needed library
  - advanced code user : use the code named "multi file" that is a full python and completely cutomisable code
  

*how can you help ?*

  - if you are a pro coder, don't hesitate to correct/improve those code
  - if you are a pro Qt, please don't juge me and help me to properly do an interface
  - if you are working on MacOS, the code properly work on it but i'm not able to generate a bundle/application that work. So if you can do it don't hesitate to contact me !
