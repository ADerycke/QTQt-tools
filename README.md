Find 2 python code available through Jupyter NoteBook and partially annoted with french and english comment...
Both code done the same thinks : use the "Summary.txt" generate by QTQt after a run to generate a simple and intergrative figure that summarize the data inverions result.

*how it work ?*

  - advanced code user : use the first code (named "multi file") that is a full python and completely cutomisable 
  - intermediate code user : use the second code (named "PyQt) is based on a graphical interface (Qt) so you don't need any specific knowledge to run it, except installing the needed library
  - what is a code ??? : i can provide an .exe file that you can use just by cliking on it (windows user)
