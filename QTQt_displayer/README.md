## What is a code ??!! :
The "software" is avaible as an .exe files that you can just start on your computer without any additionnal thinks to do. Regarding to the size of the file (>250 Mo) it's not possible for me to drop it on GitHub, so to get it just send me a mail or let a message on this GitHub.

Note : for a god know reason i'm not able to compile it on MacOS, so it's only available on windows by now...
