## What is a code ??!! :
The "software" is avaible as an .exe files that you can just start on your computer without any additionnal thinks to do. Regarding to the size of the file (>250 Mo) it's not possible for me to drop it on GitHub, so to get it just send me a mail or let a message on this GitHub.

Note : for a god know reason i'm not able to compile it on MacOS, so it's only available on windows by now...

## The user interface :
You can enter/change different parameters depending of what you want to display, or let them by default :

You can use this tool bar to edite as you desire each plot of the figure :

## QTQt displayer (PyQt) : (for beginner in code or people that want an interface)
It's a python code that use a graphical interface (base on Qt) to help users to produce the wanted plot. Personnaly, it's this one that i use.

## QTQt displayer (multi files) : (for coder)
It's a python code where you can customise the plot looking at the function parameter in the code.

## needed python librairy:

*Basic :* 
  - numpy (handle some calculation)
  - pandas (handle most of data table)
  - xarray (handle 3D data table for time-temperature histories)
  - matplotlib for pyplot (handle all the figure generation)
  - pyrolite (contain the geological time scale)

*Needed for the GUI interface :* 
  - Pyside6 and 5 for Qt (handle all the user interface)
  - tqdm (usefull to follow things for progress bar)
