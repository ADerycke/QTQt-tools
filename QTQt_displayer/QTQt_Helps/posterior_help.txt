===== Help to understand Posterior evolution =====

The Posterior corresponds to a weighting of the Likelihood value by the complexity
of the time-temperature path, and this path is estimated through its number of nodes
(or points). The weighting acts as follows: the more complex a path, the lower its
likelihood, and vice versa.

The evolution of the posterior value shows the impact of time-temperature path
complexity on data reproduction, and can be compared with the evolution of the
likelihood value.
