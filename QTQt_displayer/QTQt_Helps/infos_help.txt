===== How to read/understand inversion parameters =====

This gray box contains all the exploration parameters used during data inversion:<br>

** Keep complex histories (YES/NO) **
-> YES: QTQt will keep all possible paths and therefore, in the case of an absence of information, present all possible paths. In this case, the
 graph will be difficult to read (the entire graph being covered by paths) and/or the reconstructed thermal history will be very (too?) complex.
! Remember to look at the max posterior in this case.
-> NO: QTQt will keep only the simplest paths and therefore, in the absence of information, present a simple line.
! Beware in this case, it may be misleading to assume that the time-temperature paths are well constrained, when in fact they are not.

** Gaussian exploration (YES/NO) **
?

** t(T) path show (1/ X) **
Manages time-temperature path display by keeping a path every X post-burn-in iterations.
X can be set to >1 in the case of very constrained (i.e. small) exploration parameters or a large number of post-burn-in iteration (1 000 000)


** Time / Temperature / Offset move **
Should be scaled to your times-temperature exploration
(ex: exploration between 0 and 10Ma, then Time = 1Ma, exploration between 0 and 100Ma, Time = 10Ma)

-> first value: authorized movement of each point during exploration
-> second value: percentage of movement acceptance
-> no: no movement allowed

** FT / He / VR resample **
Set automatically at 100% to take account of errors in analyses/models, but could be reduce to 10, 1 or set at 0. 

-> first value: authorized movement of each point during exploration as a percentage of its initial value.
FT: annealing resample, He: eU or Rs or model resample, VR: ?
-> second value: percentage of movement acceptance
-> no: no movement allowed

** Max rate **
maximum cooling/heating rate allowed

** Diff. / Ann. step **
temperature interval for calculating diffusion / annealing (i.e. calculation of annealing values every XÂ°C). The lower the value, the higher
the resolution
-> First value: case of apatites
-> Second value: case of other crystals (zircon...)
