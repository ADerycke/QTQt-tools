===== How to read/interpret predicted time-temperature paths =====

This graph represents all the time-temperature paths tested during post-burn-in: if 10,000 iterations,
then 10,000 paths plotted. Each path is shown in a color defined according to its likelihood or posterior
value (depending on the choice made). 
Meaning of colors: the range of colors is from the minimum to the maximum likelihood/posterior value, and
is therefore not absolute information on path quality (good/bad path), but relative (best/least good path
obtained). It is therefore necessary to look at the reproduction of ages to judge this range of colors.

===== Paths highlighted and how to understand them : =====

Step 1: Max likelihood - the path that best reproduces the data
This is used to judge the result of the inversion: if the predicted ages are not close to the observed ages
for this path, then the inversion does not provide a usable result. On the other hand, if the predicted ages
match the observed ages, then the inversion is usable (so it's worth going on to step 2).

Step 2: Max posterior - the path that best reproduces the data while being as simple as possible
It allows us to judge whether a complex time-temperature path is necessary to reproduce the observed data:
when we obtain a good result with max likelihood (reproduction of predicted ages), the associated path may be
very complex. Looking at whether max posterior also reproduces the data allows us to assess whether this
complexity is necessary.

Expected: the average path of the set of paths obtained
allows you to obtain a time-temperature path integrating all the results, thus eliminating some of the effects
of data inversion (point-traits paths, local minimum...). In a way, it can be seen as akin to a "geological"
path.

===== Example =====
The first path systematically generated by QTQt corresponds to a "straight" line crossing the entire exploration
box (and constraints if present). Getting a graph that always contains this initial path is BAD and has several
causes:
- too few burn-ins -> increase burn-ins
- wrong exploration parameters (too large or too small) -> test other parameters
- poor input data -> the data is not "good" enough (too little, too imprecise...) to perform a data inversion.
