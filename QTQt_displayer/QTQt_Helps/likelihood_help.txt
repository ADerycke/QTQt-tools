===== Help to understand the likelihood evolution  =====

Likelihood is a value calculated as a function of predicted and observed data for
a define time-temperature path. It is generally represented as a logarithm with values
ranging from negative (poor data reproduction) to zero (theoretical values of perfect
data reproduction).
Tracking this value during a data inversion is therefore a good way of finding out
whether a good time-temperature path is being approached (Likelihood converging to 0).

===== Example =====

First case: likelihood approaches 0, but has not yet reached a plateau value -> it is
therefore necessary to run the model over more iterations, as it will converge towards
a more accurate time-temperature path (BAD).

Second case: likelihood decreases, which is not good and means that time-temperature
path exploration parameters are poorly defined (probably too constrained). (BAD)

Third case: likelihood has stabilized at a value close to 0, so the inversion has probably
converged on the best time-temperature path. (GOOD)
