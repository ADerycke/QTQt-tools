===== Graph explanation =====

This graph represents the ages actually observed (abscissa) vs. the ages predicted (ordinate)
for a defined temperature time path. These paths can be maximum likelihood, maximum posterior
and expected (see thermal history help).

===== Help to understand ages =====

To understand this graph: the closer the predicted ages are to the observed ages, the more 
reliable the predicted thermal path will be. So, in a perfect (theoretical) case, all the 
ages line up on the 1/1 line (dotted black line).
